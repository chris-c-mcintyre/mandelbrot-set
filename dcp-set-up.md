# Setting up DCP
The Distributed Compute Protocol is an easy-to-use, secure and powerful parallel computing platform built on modern web
Technology. 

The [following guide](https://docs.dcp.dev/guides/developer-guide.html) will link you to all the resources in order to get you started. It will be great if you could get a head start and get setup ahead of Thursday but if thatâ€™s not possible or if you get stuck, DO NOT FEAR, we will have plenty of support for you during the day. You'll need to follow the following steps outlined in the guide,
### 1. Register for a Portal account
### 2. Download and set up your keystores
### 3. Set up your development environment
I've already helped you with part of step 3 so just following the instructions under Node.js and you'll be ready to run a job!

To clarify you do not need to follow the instructions for Vanilla web, Computational Notebooks or Deploying jobs.
